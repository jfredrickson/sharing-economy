            <h2>Sharing Economy Conference: Boston</h2>
            <img src="images/intro-circle.png" alt="Circle of people, all connected by arrows representing sharing">
            <p>This conference introduces the idea that ownership and access are shared between corporations, start-ups, non-governmental organizations, and people. The Sharing Economy results in new products, services, and businesses that can combine resources to enable more access, knowledge, tools, and in the end, more productivity.</p>
            <p>According to a recent report from Altimeter Group, an independent research firm, the sharing economy is a $2 billion industry already with a project value of over $100 billion.</p>
            <p>The sharing economy includes a range of structures including for-profit, non-profit, barter and co-operative. The sharing economy enables expanded access to products, services and talent beyond one owner. Corporations, governments and individuals all actively participate as buyers, sellers, lenders or borrowers in these varied and evolving organizational structures. Shared offerings are based on a set of values that includes trust, transparency, economic empowerment, creative expression, authenticity, community resilience and human connection.</p>
            <p>Join experts in business, law, policy, sociology, and environmental planning to discuss how the Sharing Economy can benefit the Boston community and beyond.</p>
